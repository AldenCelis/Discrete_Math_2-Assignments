    "### Question 1\n",
    "**Expected Value of a Binomial Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to demonstrate that in a series of repeated trials (denoted by $Y$), the average value we expect (expected value) is equal to $n * p_i$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n$ represents the total number of trials conducted.\n",
    "* $p_i$ represents the probability of success in each individual trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expected Value of a Single Trial (Y_i):**\n",
    "   - To find the expected value of a single trial ($Y_i$), we consider all possible outcomes ($y_i$) weighted by their corresponding probabilities ($P(Y_i = y_i)$). This is expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y_i] = sum(y_i * P(Y_i = y_i)) for all possible values of y_i\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability of Each Outcome (Y_i):**\n",
    "   - Since each trial follows a binomial distribution, the probability of getting a specific outcome (`y_i`) can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - $binom(n, y_i)$: This represents the number of ways to achieve $y_i$ successes out of $n$ trials.\n",
    "     - $p_i^(y_i)$: This signifies the probability of success in each trial raised to the power of the number of successes ($y_i$).\n",
    "     - $(1 - p_i)^(n - y_i)$: This represents the probability of failure in each trial raised to the power of the number of failures ($n - y_i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected Value of a Single Trial (Formula):**\n",
    "   - Combining the probability and outcome for each possible value of $Y_i$, we get the formula for the expected value of a single trial:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y_i] = sum(y_i * binom(n, y_i) * p_i^(y_i) * (1 - p_i)^(n - y_i)) for all possible values of y_i\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expected Value of a Single Trial (Result):**\n",
    "   - This formula, when evaluated for a binomial distribution, is known to simplify to $n * p_i$. Therefore, the expected value of each trial ($Y_i$) is $E[Y_i] = n * p_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Expected Value of the Sum (Y):**\n",
    "   - Since the trials ($Y_1$, $Y_2$, ..., $Y_k$) are assumed to be independent (the outcome of one trial doesn't affect the others), the expected value of their sum ($Y$) is simply the sum of their individual expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Expected Value of the Sum (Formula):**\n",
    "   - The expected value of the sum ($Y$) is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y] = E[Y_1] + E[Y_2] + ... + E[Y_k]\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Expected Value of the Sum (Result):**\n",
    "   - Substituting the known expected value for each trial ($n * p_i$):\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y] = n * p_1 + n * p_2 + ... + n * p_k\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Factoring out `n`, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y] = n * (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Since the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes in a trial is always 1, this simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E[Y] = n * 1 = n\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for a series of independent Bernoulli trials ($Y$), the expected value of their sum is indeed $n * p_i$.\n",

    "$y_i$: This represents the number of individuals in the $i-th$ age group (e.g., $y_1$might be the number of people in the 18-24 age group).\n",
    "$p_i$: This represents the proportion of people in the $i-th$age group in the entire population (e.g., $p_1$ might be the proportion of people aged 18-24 in the whole population).\n",
    "$!$ : This symbol represents a factorial. For example, 5! is 5 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 3, and so on.\n",
    " Expected Number in an Age Group:\n",
    "\n",
    " We can also calculate the expected number of people in a specific age group in a random sample. This is simply the total sample size (n) multiplied by the proportion ($p_i$) of that age group in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, if you're drawing a sample of 500 people and the proportion of people aged 65 and above in the population is 0.16, you would expect to have around:\n",

    "\n",
    "The probability distribution for an experiment involving independent trials with success ($S$) or failure ($F$) outcomes can be derived as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of observing $y$ successes in $n$ trials follows a binomial distribution due to the independence of trials. The binomial probability formula expresses this probability:\n",

    "$$E[y] = \\sum_{y=0}^{n} y \\cdot \\binom{n}{y} p^y q^{n-y}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "First, calculate $P(Y = 9)$ and $P(Y = 10)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y = 9) = \\binom{10}{9} (0.3)^9 (0.7)^1 \\approx 0.00014368$$\n",
    "$$P(Y = 10) = (0.3)^{10} \\approx 0.0000059049$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Poisson Probability Mass Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution describes the probability of getting a specific number of events (e.g., successes) in a fixed interval. The probability mass function (PMF) defines the probability $p(y)$ of each possible outcome ($y$):\n",
